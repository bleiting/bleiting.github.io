Well, some how you have arrived at my home page.  So let me tell you about myself.

## Who Am I

I am Ben Leiting, an independent software developer and father of two.  I own
and manage Fast Stack Development, LLC.

I have been interesting in computers for as long as I can remember, dialing into
BBS's, building computers for a local computer repair shop in high school.

I've worked at Honeywell Defense Avionics Systems where I worked on UIs and a
simulator in C++.  I've also worked for nine years developing electronic product
registration websites and apps, creating transactional and marketing emails for
a company called Leader Technologies / Aviata.  I helped redesign a web survey
engine, the web registration frameworks and helped create a brand new reporting
system using AngularJS and InfiniDB.

And now I'm trying to do my own thing.

## What do I do

Primarily I do web programming with PHP.  I've recently used AngularJS and I
enjoy building an application primarily with Javascript.

I've built a lot of programs in perl to help analyse time series data and watch
for outliers, to help with code deployment, to send templated emails

I've worked on Android applications, and that is a lot of fun.

I like to play with R, postgres, and emacs in my spare time.
